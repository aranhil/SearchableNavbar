*Searchable Navbar* is a Visual Studio extension that replaces the standard navigation bar with a searchable navigation bar. It currently only supports C++ and uses [Ctags](https://github.com/universal-ctags/ctags) to generate the function tags.

## Setting up in Visual Studio
## Installation
1. After installing the extension, an additional navigation bar will be available at the top part of the active document. You can assign a shortcut to open the navigation bar and start searching by going to **Tools >> Options >> Environment >> Keyboard**, the command name is **SearchableNavbar.Open**.
